# Relay messages manually

{% partial file="/snippets/_axelar-relaying-disclaimer.md" /%}

When transferring tokens or messages through Axelar Amplifier Gateway from XRPL or XRPL EVM Sidechain, a relaying process is required to trigger the source gateway on Axelar Amplifier from the source chain. 

For XRPL EVM Sidechain Devnet and XRPL Devnet, the relaying process for XRP transactions is done automatically through the portal. However, since general message passing or other token transfers are not automated, a manual relaying process is required.

Here you will find two guides, one for each chain, to help you with the relaying process:

- [XRPL EVM Sidechain to XRPL](./relay-transfer-xrpl-evm-sidechain-to-xrpl.md)
- [XRPL to XRPL EVM Sidechain](./relay-transfer-xrpl-to-xrpl-evm-sidechain.md)
