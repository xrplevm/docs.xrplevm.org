# Interacting with the Node CLI

This guide provides an overview of the `exrpd` CLI (Command-Line Interface) for the XRPL EVM Sidechain. It is intended for newcomers who want to explore and interact with their own node at a deeper level. You will find the main commands and subcommands below, along with short descriptions of what they do and tips on how to use them.

## Overview

The `exrpd` CLI is organized into primary commands. Each command may have one or more **subcommands**. To list subcommands, you can run:

```
exrpd <command> --help
```

or, to see the main help, simply run:

```
exrpd --help
```

This displays usage, available commands, and descriptions for each command. The following sections cover each major command category in more detail.

## Configuration Commands

#### `exrpd config`
Use the `config` command to manage node configuration. This is helpful for setting up or inspecting config files.

| Subcommand | Description                                                                                            |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `diff`     | Outputs all config values that differ from the default `app.toml` configuration.                       |
| `get`      | Displays the current value of a specific configuration parameter.                                      |
| `home`     | Prints the folder used as the binary home directory. *(When using `confix` standalone, no home is set.)* |
| `migrate`  | Migrates a Cosmos SDK app configuration file to a specified version.                                   |
| `set`      | Sets a new value for a given configuration parameter.                                                  |
| `view`     | Displays the entire configuration file.                                                                |

**Examples**

- **Check all deviations from default config:**
  ```
  exrpd config diff
  ```
- **Get a specific config value:**
  ```
  exrpd config get <key_name>
  ```
- **Set a config value:**
  ```
  exrpd config set <key_name> <new_value>
  ```
- **Display current config file contents:**
  ```
  exrpd config view
  ```

## Key Management

#### `exrpd keys`
Use the `keys` command to manage local keys (private/public key pairs) for your application. This includes creating new keys, importing/exporting existing keys, and more.

{% admonition type="info" name="Advanced configuration" %}
Managing your node’s keys is essential. If you plan to operate a production node or validator, make sure to review the advanced key management configurations on the [Managing keys](../validators/managing-keys.md) page.
