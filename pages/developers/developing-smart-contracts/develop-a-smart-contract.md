# Develop a Smart Contract

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on blockchain networks, enabling trustless and automated interactions. On the **XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Sidechain**, developers can write, deploy, verify, and interact with Solidity-based smart contracts, leveraging the XRPL’s speed, low transaction costs, and the interoperability of Cosmos IBC and Axelar cross-chain messaging systems. This page introduces the foundational concepts and steps required to start developing smart contracts on the XRPL EVM, aimed at junior developers with a vision for future cross-chain innovation.

## What Are Smart Contracts?

Smart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain that execute automatically when predefined conditions are met. These contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, making processes transparent, efficient, and secure. With the XRPL EVM, you can deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts while benefiting from:

- **Fast Transactions:** Block times under 4 seconds.
- **Low Fees:** A fraction of the cost compared to Ethereum.
- **Interoperability:** Cross-chain capabilities via **Axelar General Message Passing (GMP)** and **Cosmos IBC**, enabling interaction with other EVM and Cosmos chains.

## Technologies You Need

To develop, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on the XRPL EVM, you’ll need:

1. **Solidity:** The primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
2. **Development Tools:**
   - **Remix IDE** for quick prototyping.
   - **Hardhat** for advanced project management and automation.
3. **Wallet:**
   - **MetaMask** to interact with the XRPL EVM network.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Write the Smart Contract
Start by learning Solidity, the language used to write smart contracts. Use Remix IDE for simple contracts or Hardhat for more complex projects. Ensure your contracts follow best practices for security and efficiency.

### 2. Deploy the Smart Contract
Refer to the [Deploy the Smart Contract](./deploy-the-smart-contract.md) page for a step-by-step guide to deploying your smart contract using Remix or Hardhat. You’ll:

- Set up MetaMask to connect to the XRPL EVM.
- Compile your contract.
- Deploy the contract on the XRPL EVM network.

### 3. Verify the Smart Contract
After deployment, verify your smart contract’s source code on the XRPL EVM Explorer. This ensures transparency and allows others to interact with your contract confidently. Follow the guide on [Verify the Smart Contract](./verify-the-smart-contract.md).

### 4. Interact with the Smart Contract
Once deployed and verified, you can interact with your smart contract using libraries like **web3.js** or **ethers.js**. Learn how to:

- Connect to the XRPL EVM.
- Call functions from your deployed contract.
- Handle responses programmatically or via a frontend. Details are provided in [Interact with the Smart Contract](./interact-with-the-smart-contract.md).

## Future Developments: Cross-Chain Interoperability

The XRPL EVM is not just about isolated smart contract functionality; it’s a gateway to cross-chain innovation. Through Cosmos IBC and Axelar’s advanced tools, you can:

- **Build Cross-Chain dApps:** Enable seamless communication and asset transfers across blockchains.
- **Utilize Axelar GMP:** Execute smart contract calls between XRPL EVM and other EVM/Cosmos chains.
- **Leverage Axelar ITS:** Move assets like tokens and NFTs between chains with ease.

### Example:
A decentralized exchange (DEX) on the XRPL EVM could interact with liquidity pools on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Cosmos Hub, creating a unified cross-chain trading experience.
