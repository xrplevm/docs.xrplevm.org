# Interact with the Smart Contract

Interacting with smart contracts on the **XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Sidechain** allows developers and users to execute contract functions, query data, and create seamless integrations with decentralized applications (dApps). This guide outlines how to connect to the XRPL EVM network, call smart contract functions, and manage responses using popular tools like **web3.js**, **ethers.js**, and user-friendly interfaces such as MetaMask and Remix IDE.

---

## Prerequisites

Before interacting with a smart contract, ensure you have the following set up:

1. **Deployed Smart Contract**:
   - Deploy your smart contract using the guide: [Deploy a Smart Contract](./deploy-the-smart-contract.md).
   - Obtain the contract's address after deployment.

2. **XRPL EVM Network**:
   - Connect your wallet to the XRPL EVM Devnet using MetaMask or other compatible tools. 
   - Network details:
     - **RPC URL**: [https://rpc.xrplevm.org](https://rpc.xrplevm.org)
     - **Chain ID**: `1440002`

3. **Smart Contract ABI**:
   - The Application Binary Interface (ABI) is required to interact with the contract. You can find the ABI in your contract's build files or Remix IDE.

4. **Wallet Setup**:
   - Ensure you have test XRP ($XRP) for transaction fees. Use the [XRPL EVM Faucet](../../users/faucet.md) to request $XRP.

## Interaction Methods

### 1. Using Remix IDE
Remix provides a simple way to interact with deployed contracts.

#### Steps:
1. **Connect to XRPL EVM**:
   - Open Remix IDE.
   - Select **Injected Web3** under the environment settings to connect MetaMask.

2. **Load the Contract**:
   - Paste the deployed contract's address in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
   - Import the contract's ABI if required.

3. **Call Functions**:
   - Use the Remix interface to call public or payable functions on your contract.
   - MetaMask will prompt you to sign and confirm transactions.

4. **View Results**:
   - The response from the contract is displayed in the Remix console.

### 2. Using web3.js
The **web3.js** library provides a programmatic way to interact with smart contracts in JavaScript.

#### Steps:
1. **Install web3.js**:
   ```bash
   npm install web3
   ```

2. **Connect to XRPL EVM**:
   ```javascript
   const Web3 = require('web3');
   const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.xrplevm.org');
   ```

3. **Load the Contract**:
   ```javascript
   const contractABI = [/* Your Contract ABI */];
   const contractAddress = '0xYourContractAddress';
   const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);
   ```

4. **Call Functions**:
   ```javascript
   // Example: Reading a public variable
   const result = await contract.methods.publicVariable().call();
   console.log('Result:', result);

   // Example: Sending a transaction
   const receipt = await contract.methods
       .setVariable('New Value')
       .send({ from: '0xYourWalletAddress' });
   console.log('Transaction Receipt:', receipt);
   ```

### 3. Using ethers.js
The **ethers.js** library is another popular option for interacting with smart contracts.

#### Steps:
1. **Install ethers.js**:
   ```bash
   npm install ethers
   ```

2. **Connect to XRPL EVM**:
   ```javascript
   const { ethers } = require('ethers');
   const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.xrplevm.org');
   const wallet = new ethers.Wallet('0xYourPrivateKey', provider);
   ```

3. **Load the Contract**:
   ```javascript
   const contractABI = [/* Your Contract ABI */];
   const contractAddress = '0xYourContractAddress';
   const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, wallet);
   ```

4. **Call Functions**:
   ```javascript
   // Example: Reading a public variable
   const result = await contract.publicVariable();
   console.log('Result:', result);

   // Example: Sending a transaction
   const tx = await contract.setVariable('New Value');
   const receipt = await tx.wait();
   console.log('Transaction Receipt:', receipt);
   ```

### 4. Frontend Interaction
You can also create a frontend to interact with smart contracts using frameworks like **React** or **Vue.js**. Use **ethers.js** or **web3.js** to connect the frontend with the contract.

---

## Debugging and Testing

### 1. Use the XRPL EVM Explorer
- Access the [XRPL EVM Explorer](https://explorer.xrplevm.org) to view transaction details, logs, and contract interactions.

### 2. Check Gas Fees
- Ensure sufficient $XRP balance in your wallet to cover gas fees for transactions.

### 3. Debug Contract Functions
- Use the Remix IDE debugger to trace contract execution and identify issues.

## Advanced Use Case: Cross-Chain Interactions

The XRPL EVM supports cross-chain functionality via **Axelar General Message Passing (GMP)** and **Cosmos IBC**. These tools allow you to:
- Execute smart contract calls on other EVM or Cosmos chains.
- Transfer assets seamlessly between chains.

### Example:
A decentralized voting dApp deployed on the XRPL EVM can fetch real-time voter statistics from Ethereum using Axelar GMP.
