## Review What You've Learned

Through the previous pages, you’ve learned to:

1. **Develop a Smart Contract**:
   - Understand the fundamentals of Solidity programming and write Ethereum-compatible smart contracts optimized for the XRPL EVM.  
   *(Read more: [Develop a Smart Contract](./develop-a-smart-contract.md))*

2. **Deploy a Smart Contract**:
   - Use tools like Remix IDE and Hardhat to deploy your contracts on the XRPL EVM Sidechain.
   *(Read more: [Deploy a Smart Contract](./deploy-the-smart-contract.md))*

3. **Verify a Smart Contract**:
   - Ensure transparency and build user trust by verifying your contract’s source code on the XRPL EVM Explorer.
   *(Read more: [Verify a Smart Contract](./verify-the-smart-contract.md))*

4. **Interact with a Smart Contract**:
   - Execute smart contract functions, query data, and integrate contract calls into your applications using libraries like `ethers.js` or `web3.js`.

## Explore Advanced Development Topics

Take your skills to the next level by exploring advanced use cases and emerging technologies:

1. **Cross-Chain Applications**:
   - Learn how to utilize Axelar General Message Passing (GMP) and Cosmos IBC to create interoperable dApps that interact across multiple blockchains.

2. **Token Standards**:
   - Dive into token standards like ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens) to design and implement custom tokens on the XRPL EVM.

3. **DeFi Protocols**:
   - Explore decentralized finance (DeFi) concepts such as lending, staking, and automated market makers (AMMs) to build innovative financial solutions.

4. **AI-Driven Smart Contracts**:
   - Integrate AI tools to automate contract testing, optimize gas usage, and generate dynamic smart contract logic.

## Build a Frontend dApp with XRPL EVM

To complete your understanding of dApp development, create a frontend application that connects to the XRPL EVM. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you start building a **Next.js TypeScript Starter Kit** that integrates Wallet Connect, MetaMask, and XRPL EVM functionality.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Starter Kit
Start with a pre-configured template for building blockchain frontends:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kenyiu/web3_starter_kit.git
cd nextjs-dapp-starter
```

#### 2. Configure the Environment
Create a `.env.local` file with the following variable:
```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID>
```
Replace `<YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID>` with your actual WalletConnect project ID from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).

#### 3. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Add XRPL EVM Network Configuration
Update the `src/chains/xrplEvmChain.ts` file with XRPL EVM-specific details:
```typescript
import { defineChain, type Chain } from 'viem';

export const xrplEvmChain = defineChain({
  id: 1440002,
  name: 'XRPL EVM',
  nativeCurrency: {
    name: 'XRP',
    symbol: 'XRP',
    decimals: 18,
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: { http: ['https://rpc.xrplevm.org'] },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: { name: 'Blockscout', url: 'https://explorer.xrplevm.org' },
  },
} as const satisfies Chain);
```

#### 5. Run the Development Server
Launch the app with the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to interact with your dApp.

### Example Features

The Starter Kit includes basic functionality to interact with smart contracts and the XRPL EVM. Below are some key features:

#### Connect Wallet
Use Wallet Connect or MetaMask to connect to the XRPL EVM network:
```tsx
<Button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect Wallet</Button>
```

#### Sign Messages
Allow users to sign messages programmatically:
```tsx
<Button onClick={() => signMessage({ message: 'Hello, XRPL EVM!' })}>
  Sign Message
</Button>
```

#### Send Transactions
Send transactions with custom amounts:
```tsx
<Button
  onClick={() =>
    sendTransaction({
      to: '0xRecipientAddress',
      value: parseEther('10'),
    })
  }
>
  Send 10 XRP
</Button>
```
