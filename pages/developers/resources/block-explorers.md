# Block Explorers

Block explorers are web-based tools that allow you to search, analyze, and view on-chain data. They provide insights into blocks, transactions, addresses, and other critical metrics, helping both developers and end-users understand the state and health of the network. Different explorers may offer unique features, such as advanced analytics, rich data visualization, or API integrations for programmatic queries.
