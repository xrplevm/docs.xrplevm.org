# Introduction

A cross-chain dApp is a decentralized application that operates across multiple blockchain networks. These applications enable users to seamlessly interact with different blockchains, offering a unified experience for accessing and managing assets and services across various ecosystems.

For the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem, cross-chain dApps unlock significant potential by providing interoperability with key features like EVM-compatible smart contracts, all while maintaining the XRPL's renowned benefits of speed, security, and low-cost transactions.

## The Role of Axelar in Cross-Chain Interoperability

Achieving seamless cross-chain compatibility requires a robust communication layer, which is where Axelar comes in. Axelar is a cross-chain communication protocol that facilitates interaction between dApps and multiple blockchain networks.

With Axelar, tokens can be transferred between chains securely and efficiently. This capability is especially valuable for bridging the XRP Ledger and XRPL EVM, as XRP serves as the native token for both. For instance, XRP can be used to pay gas fees for executing EVM-compatible smart contract calls in the XRPL EVM. To learn more about this process, refer to the [Send Tokens page](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/send-tokens/introduction/).

Beyond token transfers, Axelar supports General Message Passing (GMP), a feature that enables direct function calls on other connected chains. This functionality expands the possibilities for dApps by allowing them to trigger complex workflows and interactions across chains.
