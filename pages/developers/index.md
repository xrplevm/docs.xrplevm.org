# Welcome

Welcome to the XRPL EVM developer documentation! This section provides an overview of the XRPL EVM environment and guides you through the essential steps to start building, testing, and deploying your projects. Whether you’re an experienced Ethereum developer or completely new to blockchain development, XRPL EVM offers a familiar yet enhanced environment for creating next-generation decentralized applications (dApps).

## Why Build on XRPL EVM?

**Ethereum Compatibility, XRP Ledger Performance:**  
XRPL EVM brings together the reliability and scalability of the XRP Ledger with the flexibility and developer-friendly tooling of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This combination means you can leverage the robust XRP Ledger’s consensus, speed, and low transaction costs while maintaining full compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem’s tooling, smart contracts, and libraries.

**Seamless Tooling & Ecosystem:**  
Because XRPL EVM is fully compatible with the EVM, you can use popular Ethereum development tools like Truffle, Hardhat, and Foundry without modification. Additionally, widely-adopted libraries and frameworks like Web3.js or Ethers.js will work out-of-the-box, enabling you to integrate existing code, workflows, and best practices quickly.

**Enhanced Interoperability:**  
With XRPL EVM, your dApps can benefit from interoperability with other networks and ecosystems, including the existing XRP Ledger ecosystem. This opens the door to new liquidity options, cross-chain functionalities, and opportunities for expansion.

## Key Development Areas

1. **Smart Contract Development:**  
   Write, test, and deploy Solidity-based contracts on XRPL EVM. If you’re coming from Ethereum, your contracts should “just work” with minimal or no changes. If you’re new to Solidity, this environment offers a low-friction onramp into the broader EVM-compatible development space.

2. **dApp Integration:**  
   Build and integrate decentralized applications that interact seamlessly with XRPL EVM. You can connect front-end applications using standard Web3 libraries and frameworks, enabling users to read contract states, submit transactions, and more.

3. **Infrastructure and Tooling:**  
   XRPL EVM supports the familiar suite of Ethereum tools for local development, testing, and deployment. You can rely on tools like:

   - **Hardhat** or **Truffle** for contract development and testing
   - **Ethers.js** or **Web3.js** for on-chain interactions
   - **OpenZeppelin Contracts** for secure, audited smart contract standards

4. **Bridging and Cross-Chain Interactions:**  
   While this section focuses mainly on direct development within XRPL EVM, you’ll also find opportunities to connect and move assets between XRPL EVM and other chains, leveraging cross-chain bridges and interoperability solutions.

## Getting Started

In the following pages, you’ll find step-by-step guides, reference materials, and best practices for each stage of your development journey:

- **Environment Setup:** Learn how to configure your local development environment with the right tools and connect to XRPL EVM endpoints.
- **Contract Deployment:** Discover how to compile and deploy Solidity contracts, verify them on the network, and manage contract addresses.
- **Interaction with Contracts:** Explore how to call smart contract functions, handle events, and integrate your contract with external systems and dApps.
- **Testing and Security:** Understand best practices for testing, auditing, and securing your contracts to ensure a reliable and trustless ecosystem.
- **Advanced Topics:** Delve deeper into topics like gas optimization, on-chain governance mechanisms, and advanced contract patterns.
