# What is the XRPL EVM

The **XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Sidechain** is an innovative blockchain ecosystem that extends the capabilities of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) by introducing Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility. This enables developers to build and deploy Solidity-based smart contracts on the XRPL ecosystem, combining the cost-efficiency and speed of XRPL with the programmability of Ethereum.

## Key Features of the XRPL EVM

### 1. Ethereum Compatibility

- **Smart Contracts:** Fully supports Solidity, Ethereum's native smart contract language.
- **Tool Integration:** Developers can use familiar Ethereum tools such as Remix, Truffle, and MetaMask to interact with the XRPL EVM.
- **EVM Equivalence:** Enables seamless migration of Ethereum-based applications to the XRPL EVM Sidechain with minimal changes.

### 2. Low Costs and High Performance

- **Transaction Fees:** Significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum, making the XRPL EVM more accessible for developers and users.
- **Fast Transactions:** Block finalization occurs in under 4 seconds, ensuring quick transaction confirmation.

### 3. Cross-Chain Interoperability

- **Axelar Network Integration:** Facilitates cross-chain asset transfers and messaging between the XRPL, XRPL EVM, and other blockchains.
- **Bridge Functionality:** Use the XRPL EVM bridge to move assets between the XRP Ledger and the EVM sidechain.

### 4. Decentralized Development Environment

- **Built on Cosmos SDK:** Provides a modular and scalable framework for blockchain development.
- **Powered by Evmos:** Brings Ethereum compatibility to the Cosmos ecosystem, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Uses CometBFT (Tendermint), ensuring Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and high throughput.

## Why Use the XRPL EVM?

The XRPL EVM bridges the gap between two powerful blockchain ecosystems: the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. This combination creates unique opportunities for developers and users:

### 1. Cost-Efficient dApp Development

The XRPL's low transaction fees reduce the cost of deploying and interacting with smart contracts, making it an attractive choice for developers and startups building decentralized applications (dApps).

**Example:** A decentralized exchange (DEX) can be deployed on XRPL EVM with lower operational costs compared to Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain.

### 2. Global Payments Meets Programmability

The XRPL is known for its robust global payment infrastructure. Adding EVM compatibility enables developers to programmatically manage those payments through smart contracts, enabling:

- Automated settlements.
- DeFi applications like lending, staking, and yield farming.
- Tokenized cross-border transactions.

**Example:** A lending protocol on XRPL EVM can leverage XRPL's payment infrastructure for faster and cheaper loan settlements.

### 3. Cross-Chain Asset Mobility

With Axelar and the XRPL EVM bridge, assets can move seamlessly between the XRPL and other blockchain ecosystems, creating interoperability for:

- Cross-chain DeFi platforms.
- Multi-chain NFT marketplaces.

**Example:** An NFT marketplace built on XRPL EVM can support assets from Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and XRPL.

### 4. Enhanced User and Developer Experience

- Developers familiar with Ethereum can transition to XRPL EVM without learning new tools or languages.
- Users benefit from XRPL's speed and low fees while interacting with Ethereum-compatible dApps.

## Current Status

The XRPL EVM is currently in its **Devnet stage**, with a **Testnet launch planned for the second half of January**. This phased rollout ensures thorough testing and validation before the mainnet deployment.

### Recent Updates:

- **Chain Upgrades:** Improved network stability and performance with the latest Cosmos SDK and Evmos updates.
- **Explorer Enhancements:** Upgrades to both Cosmos and EVM explorers for better network visibility.
- **Validator Onboarding:** Efforts to decentralize the network further by adding high-quality validators from diverse geographies.
- **Transaction Fee Optimization:** Plans to adjust fees to remain competitive with networks like Binance and Polygon (~1¢ per transaction).
