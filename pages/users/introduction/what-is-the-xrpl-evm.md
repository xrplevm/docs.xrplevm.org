# What is the XRPL EVM

The **XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** is a transformative extension of the XRP Ledger ecosystem that introduces Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities through a dedicated sidechain. Built on the Cosmos SDK, this sidechain leverages a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus model to maintain high performance and low latency while preserving the core attributes of the XRP Ledger. It connects to the XRP Ledger via the Axelar network, using XRP bridged from the XRPL as its native currency, facilitating seamless asset transfers and communication between the XRPL and the EVM sidechain. This integration fuses the XRP Ledger’s proven speed, cost-efficiency, and security with Ethereum’s versatility, empowering developers to build and deploy Solidity-based smart contracts in a high-speed, low-cost, and liquidity-rich environment.

## Key Features of the XRPL EVM

### Ethereum Compatibility

- **Smart Contracts:** Fully supports Solidity, Ethereum's native smart contract language.
- **Tool Integration:** Developers can use familiar Ethereum tools such as Remix, Truffle, and MetaMask to interact with the XRPL EVM.
- **EVM Equivalence:** Enables seamless migration of Ethereum-based applications to the XRPL EVM Sidechain with minimal changes.

### Low Costs and High Performance

- **Transaction Fees:** Significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum, making the XRPL EVM more accessible for developers and users.
- **Fast Transactions:** Block finalization occurs in under 4 seconds, ensuring quick transaction confirmation.

### Cross-Chain Interoperability

- **Axelar Network Integration:** Facilitates cross-chain asset transfers and messaging between the XRPL, XRPL EVM, and other blockchains.
- **Bridge Functionality:** Use the XRPL EVM bridge to move assets between the XRP Ledger and the EVM sidechain.

### Decentralized Development Environment

- **Built on Cosmos SDK:** Provides a modular and scalable framework for blockchain development.
- **Powered by Evmos:** Brings Ethereum compatibility to the Cosmos ecosystem, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Uses CometBFT (Tendermint), ensuring Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and high throughput.

## Why Use the XRPL EVM?

The XRPL EVM bridges the gap between two powerful blockchain ecosystems: the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. This combination creates unique opportunities for developers and users:

### Cost-Efficient dApp Development

The XRPL's low transaction fees reduce the cost of deploying and interacting with smart contracts, making it an attractive choice for developers and startups building decentralized applications (dApps).

### Global Payments Meets Programmability

The XRPL is known for its robust global payment infrastructure. Adding EVM compatibility enables developers to programmatically manage those payments through smart contracts, enabling:

- Automated settlements.
- DeFi applications like lending, staking, and yield farming.
- Tokenized cross-border transactions.

**Example:** A lending protocol on XRPL EVM can leverage XRPL's payment infrastructure for faster and cheaper loan settlements.

### Cross-Chain Asset Mobility

With Axelar and the XRPL EVM bridge, assets can move seamlessly between the XRPL and other blockchain ecosystems, creating interoperability for:

- Cross-chain DeFi platforms.
- Multi-chain NFT marketplaces.

**Example:** An NFT marketplace built on XRPL EVM can support assets from Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and XRPL.

### Enhanced User and Developer Experience

- Developers familiar with Ethereum can transition to XRPL EVM without learning new tools or languages.
- Users benefit from XRPL's speed and low fees while interacting with Ethereum-compatible dApps.
