# Introduction

To access the full functionality of the **XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, you will need an account and a balance of **XRP** to cover transaction fees. This section will guide you through the steps to set up your wallet, obtain XRP, and interact with the XRPL EVM.

## Getting Started with XRPL EVM

### Create a Wallet

To interact with the XRPL EVM, you need a compatible Ethereum wallet such as **MetaMask**. This wallet will serve as your gateway to manage accounts, sign transactions, and deploy smart contracts on the XRPL EVM.

- Learn how to [Install MetaMask](./install-metamask.md).
- Connect your wallet to the XRPL EVM by following the [Connect MetaMask to the XRPL EVM](./connect-to-the-xrpl-evm.md) guide.

### Obtain XRP for Transaction Fees

Every action on the XRPL EVM, such as deploying smart contracts or transferring tokens, requires a small amount of **XRP** to cover transaction fees. There are two ways to get XRP for the XRPL EVM Devnet:

1. **Use the Faucet**:
   The XRPL EVM Faucet allows you to request free test XRP for development purposes.  
   _(Read more: [Faucet](../faucet.md))_

2. **Bridge XRP from the XRPL**:
   Transfer XRP from the XRP Ledger to the XRPL EVM using the **Bridge**.  
   _(Read more: [Using the Bridge](../using-the-bridge.md))_

### Start Building and Exploring

Once your wallet is set up and funded with XRP, you’re ready to explore the XRPL EVM’s functionalities:

- **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Use tools like Remix IDE or Hardhat to deploy Solidity-based smart contracts.  
  _(Read more: [Deploy a Smart Contract](../../developers/developing-smart-contracts/deploy-the-smart-contract.md))_

- **Interact with Smart Contracts**: Use libraries like `ethers.js` or `web3.js` to interact with deployed contracts programmatically.  
  _(Read more: [Interact with a Smart Contract](../../developers/developing-smart-contracts/interact-with-the-smart-contract.md))_

- **Experiment with Cross-Chain Functionality**: Leverage Axelar General Message Passing (GMP) for interoperable applications across multiple chains.
